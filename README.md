# xkcd-tutorial
Learn how to plot xkcd-themed figures in R. This uses the **xkcd** package which is based on **ggplot2** syntax.

The documents here include a tutorial on how to plot figures in R using an [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/) theme. The PDF here was generated using R markdown -- feel free to follow along with the PDF or the Rmd file.

Note that my tutorial is based on one previously written: [xkcd: An R package for Plotting XKCD Graphics](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xkcd/vignettes/xkcd-intro.pdf).

Have fun!
